  `azLLM` is a Python package designed to interface with various large language models (LLMs) 
  from different AI providers. It offers a unified interface for interacting 
  with models from providers like OpenAI, DeepSeek, Grok, Gemini, Meta's Llama, Anthropic,

  parallel generation, error handling, and the ability 
  to parse structured responses from different models.
